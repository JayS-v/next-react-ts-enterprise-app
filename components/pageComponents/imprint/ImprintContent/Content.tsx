      <h2>LIABILITY FOR CONTENT</h2>
      <p>
        The contents of our pages were created with great care. However, we
        cannot guarantee that the content is correct, complete or up-to-date. As
        a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these
        pages according to Section 7, Paragraph 1 of the German Telemedia Act
        (TMG). According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we as a service provider
        are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information
        or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
        Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to
        general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is
        only possible from the point in time at which knowledge of a specific
        infringement of the law is known.
      </p>

      <h2>LIABILITY FOR LINKS</h2>
      <p>
        Our offer contains links to external third-party websites, the content
        of which we have no influence on. Therefore we cannot assume any
        liability for this external content. The respective provider or operator
        of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages.
        The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time
        of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.
        However, a permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not
        reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. As soon as we
        become aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>COPYRIGHT</h2>
      <p>
        The content and works on these pages created by the site operators are
        subject to German copyright law. The duplication, editing, distribution
        and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the
        written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and

        Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the

        third parties are marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware
        of a copyright infringement, we ask that you inform us accordingly. As
        soon as we become aware of legal violations, we will remove such content
        immediately.

      <p>1. Name and address of the data controller</p>
      <p>
        The controller within the meaning of the EU General Data Protection
        Regulation (DS-GVO) is

      <p>MONITAET Technology GmbH</p>

      <p>2. Name and address of the data protection officer</p>
      <p>
        The data protection officer of the person responsible for processing is:
      </p>
      <p>Igor Gendel</p>
      <p>Rehrhofer Weg 102</p>
      <p>D-29633 Munster</p>
      <p>{`Tel.: ${dataEn.tel}`}</p>
      <p>E-mail: info@monitaet.com</p>

      <h3>II. GENERAL</h3>
      <p>1. Scope of processing of personal data</p>
      <p>
        In principle, we only collect and use personal data from our users to
        the extent that this is necessary to provide a functional website and
        our content and services. If this is not the case, the personal data
        will only be used regularly with the user&apos;s consent. An exception
        applies in such cases in which it is not possible to obtain prior
        consent for actual reasons and the processing of the data is permitted
        by statutory provisions.
      </p>

      <p>2. Legal basis of processing</p>
      <p>
        Insofar as we obtain the consent of the person concerned for the
        processing of personal data, Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a EU General
        Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis for the
        processing of personal data required to fulfill a contract to which the
        data subject is a party. This also applies to processing operations that
        are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. Insofar as
        processing of personal data is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation
        to which our company is subject, Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR
        serves as the legal basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural
        person require the processing of personal data, Article 6 Paragraph 1
        lit. d GDPR serves as the legal basis. If the processing is necessary to
        safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and if
        the interests, fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms of the person
        concerned do not outweigh the first interest, Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit.
        f GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing. The legitimate
        interest of our company lies in the conduct of our business.
      </p>

      <p>3. Routine deletion and blocking of personal data</p>
      <p>
        We process and store personal data of the person concerned only for as
        long as this is necessary to achieve the purpose of storage. Storage can
        also take place if this has been provided for by the European or
        national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other regulations to
        which the person responsible for processing is subject. As soon as the
        storage purpose no longer applies or a storage period prescribed by the
        regulations mentioned expires, the personal data are routinely blocked
        or deleted.
      </p>
      <p>4. Security of your data</p>
      <p>
        When you visit our website, we use the widespread SSL (Secure Socket
        Layer) method in conjunction with the highest level of encryption
        supported by your browser. This is usually a 256-bit encryption. If your
        browser does not support 256-bit encryption, we use 128-bit v3
        technology instead. You can tell whether an individual page of our
        website is transmitted in encrypted form by the closed representation of
        the key or lock symbol in the lower status bar of your browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also use appropriate technical and organizational security measures
        to protect your data against accidental or intentional manipulation,
        partial or complete loss, destruction or against unauthorized access by
        third parties. Our security measures are continuously improved in line
        with technological development.
      </p>
